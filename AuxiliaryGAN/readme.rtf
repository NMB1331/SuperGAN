\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is the code for a modified version (applied to time-series data) of the architecture from the original AC-GAN paper (\cf2 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Conditional Image Synthesis With Auxiliary Classifier GANs\cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \outl0\strokewidth0 ). The only real difference is in this case the discriminator predicts the class label as well as whether the data is real or synthetic rather than having an additional (in our case pre-trained) model to do it.}
